# **What is the difference between IaaS, SaaS, and Paas?**
----------------------------------------------------------------
-In IaaS, you select the pre-canned OS layer, deploy the application stack, deploy your code & then add your data

-In PaaS, you deploy your code (OS/Application Stack is part of the offering) & then add your data

-In SaaS, you add your data (everything else part of the offering

# **SAAS (Software as a Service) Platform Architecture**
------------------------------------------------------------
## **SAAS Architecture:**

With this model, a single version of the application, with a single configuration is used for all customers. The application is installed on multiple machines to support scalability (called horizontal scaling). In some cases, a second version of the application is set up to offer a select group of customers with access to pre-release versions of the applications for testing purposes.

There are two main varieties of SaaS:

1.Vertical SaaS A Software which answers the needs of a specific industry (e.g., software for the healthcare, agriculture, real estate, finance industries)

2.Horizontal SaaS The products which focus on a software category (marketing, sales, developer tools, HR) but are industry agnostic.    

## **Benefit of SAAS**

It offers substantial opportunities for organizations of all sizes to shift the risks of software acquisition, and to move IT from a reactive cost center to being a proactive, value-producing part of the enterprise. Traditionally, deploying large-scale software systems has been a major undertaking. Deploying these systems across a large enterprise costs more.
